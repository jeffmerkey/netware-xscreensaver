DESCRIPTION


The _netwaresmp_ screensaver written by Jeffrey Merkey
<jeffmerkey@gmail.com> and Cosimo Streppone <cosimo@cpan.org>, based on
PopSquares, Deco hacks, loadsnake, and Novell’s Netware SMP. The
original Netware SMP screensaver was written by Jeffrey Merkey at Novell
in 1994. This version is a rewrite of the original which functions
exactly the same way as it did in Netware SMP. Each worm represents a
running system cpu processor. As system utilization increases for each
cpu, the corresponding worm for that processor gets longer and moves
more quicky across the screen. As overall system load increases, all the
worms slightly increase in speed. This screensaver is very useful for
monitoring cpu loading in a system since you can visually see processor
utilization and loading by simply observing the worms.



OPTIONS


_netwaresmp_ accepts the following options:

-   -CPUS
    Number of cpus to start. The default is the actual number of cpus
    detected from /proc/cpuinfo. If you specify more cpus than are
    installed in your system, only the worms that are mapped to an
    actual processor will grow longer and faster when cpu load increases
    for that processor. If you specify less cpus than are installed in
    your system, the program will default the display to the actual
    detected cpus.
-   -SPEEDUP
    speedup divisor to increase worm speed. functions as powers of 2
    i.e. speedup=4 runs at 4 times the speed, etc. Default value is 1.
-   -WORMSIZE
    size of the worm head in pixels in a range between 10 and 80.
    Default value is 20. Can be any value but works best if you use
    multiples of 2 to map to graphics screen dimensions (which are
    typically numbers which are multiples of 2 or 10).
-   -WINDOW
    Draw on a newly-created window. This is the default.
-   -ROOT
    Draw on the root window.
-   -MONO
    If on a color display, pretend we’re on a monochrome display.
-   -INSTALL
    Install a private colormap for the window.
-   -VISUAL _VISUAL_
    Specify which visual to use. Legal values are the name of a visual
    class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.
-   -DELAY _SECONDS_
    How long to wait before starting over. Default 5 seconds.
-   -MAX-DEPTH _INTEGER_
    How deep to subdivide. Default 12.
-   -MIN-WIDTH _INTEGER_
    -MIN-HEIGHT _INTEGER_ The size of the smallest rectangle to draw.
    Default 20x20.
-   -CYCLE
-   -NO-CYCLE
    Whether to do color cycling. Default False.
-   -CYCLE-DELAY _USECS_
    If color cycling, how often to change the colors. Default 1000000,
    or 1 second.



ENVIRONMENT


-   DISPLAY
    to get the default host and display number.
-   XENVIRONMENT
    to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global
    resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
