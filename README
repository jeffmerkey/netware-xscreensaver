Description

The _netwaresmp_ screensaver written by Jeffrey Merkey
<jeffmerkey@gmail.com> and Cosimo Streppone <cosimo@cpan.org>, based on
PopSquares, Deco hacks, loadsnake, and Novell’s Netware SMP. The
original Netware SMP screensaver was written by Jeffrey Merkey at Novell
in 1994. This version is a rewrite of the original which functions
exactly the same way as it did in Netware SMP. Each worm represents a
running system cpu processor. As system utilization increases for each
cpu, the corresponding worm for that processor gets longer and moves
more quicky across the screen. As overall system load increases, all the
worms slightly increase in speed. This screensaver is very useful for
monitoring cpu loading in a system since you can visually see processor
utilization and loading by simply observing the worms.


Quick Start Guide

You can download precompiled Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) and Debian
(DEB) packages which contain the entire XScreensaver program with
netwaresmp integrated from the release page for this project, or you can
build the program from the git sources. The current netwaresmp
xscreensaver module is compiled against the XScreensaver v6.08 base and
you may have to deinstall any older version of the Xscreensaver program
you are running and then reinstall with the RPM or DEB packages listed
in the releases section.

Most Linux distributions use an outdated xscreensaver program which
lacks current bug fixes and new capabilities.
It’s a good idea to upgrade to the xscreensaver 6.08 release since there
have been many bug fixes and enhanced features in the most current
maintained version of XScreensaver.

If you want to build the program from scratch with the git sources
rather than use the pre-compiled RPMS and DEB packages, then please skip
to the section Building the Screensaver from Source for instructions on
how to do this.

Packages are provided in binary and source versions, and can be
downloaded and installed directly or rebuilt for a different target
architecture such as ARM64. Package types are Red Hat Package Manager
(RPM) packages and Debian (DEB) packages for binary installation and
Source RPM packages (SRPMS) and Debbuild SDEB packages for source code
installation.

RPM and DEB packages for each release include a binary architecture
specific package and a source package which can be downloaded and
built/rebuilt and which contains the source code.

For example, the release v6.08-4 contains the following packages in the
release section:

RPM BASED PACKAGES (REDHAT, CENTOS, SUSE)

-   xscreensaver-netwaresmp-6.08-5.src.rpm
-   xscreensaver-netwaresmp-6.08-5.x86_64.rpm

DEBIAN BASED PACKAGES (DEBIAN, UBUNTU)

-   xscreensaver-netwaresmp-1.6.08-5.sdeb
-   xscreensaver_netwaresmp_1.6.08-5_amd64.deb

REMOVING A PREVIOUS INSTALLATION OF OUTDATED VERSIONS OF XSCREENSAVER

Most of the XScreensaver packages shipped or distributed by RedHat,
Debian, and many Distros of Linux are quite old and outdated and do not
contain current bug fixes or support and should be upgraded in any
event.

To remove a previously installed or outdated version of XScreensaver
with the RPM package manager:

    rpm -e xscreensaver

To remove a previously installed or outdated version of XScreensaver and
all package dependencies with the dnf or yum RPM package manager for RPM
based Linux Distributions:

    dnf remove xscreensaver

To remove a previously installed or outdated version of XScreensaver
with the DEB package manager for Debian based Linux distributions:

    dpkg -r xscreensaver

To remove a previously installed or outdated version of XScreensaver and
all package dependencies with the apt DEB package manager for Debian
based Linux Distributions:

    apt autoremove xscreensaver

or

    apt-get autoremove xscreensaver

INSTALLING BINARY PACKAGES

To install the binary package with the RPM package manager:

    rpm -i xscreensaver-netwaresmp-6.08-5.x86_64.rpm

To deinstall the RPM binary package:

    rpm -e xscreensaver-netwaresmp

To install the binary package with the Debian dpkg package manager for
amd64:

    dpkg -i xscreensaver_netwaresmp_1.6.08-5_amd64.deb

To deinstall the Debian dpkg binary package:

    dpkg -r xscreensaver_netwaresmp

INSTALLING SOURCE PACKAGES

To install the source package with the RPM package manager:

    rpm -i xscreensaver-netwaresmp-6.08-5.src.rpm

_(Note: rpm installs the source code files in /root/rpmbuild/ as top
directory for RedHat and CentOS platforms. SuSe platforms install the
source code files in /usr/src/packages/)_

To install the source package with the Debbuild package tool:

    debbuild -i xscreensaver-netwaresmp-1.6.08-5.sdeb

_(Note: Debbuild installs the source code files in /root/debbuild/ as
top directory)_

For building or rebuilding RPMS or DEB Packages after you have installed
the associated source packages on your platform, refer to the following:

-   Building the Screensaver as an RPM Package (Redhat/CentOS/SuSe)
-   Building the Screensaver as a Debian Package (Debian/Ubuntu)


CONFIGURING XSCREENSAVER

For detailed instructions on how to install and configure the
XScreensaver base program, please refer to the online Documentation and
Manuals for XScreensaver. You should also review the Frequently Asked
Questions for information about common integration and installation
questions and detailed information about the XScreensaver program
itself.

You can report any bugs you encounter regarding the XScreensaver program
and utilities by opening a bug report at the main XScreensaver support
website at www.jwz.org.

You can download other versions of XScreensaver, including the most
recent versions at the XScreensaver Download Page.


_NETWARESMP_ OPTIONS

    netwaresmp [-cpus  number of cpus] [-speedup  divisor] [-wormsize  pixels] 
    [-display host:display.screen] [-foreground color] [-background color] 
    [-window] [-root] [-mono] [-circles] [-install] [-visual visual]


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

_netwaresmp_ accepts the following options:

-   –CPUS
    Number of cpus to start. The default is the actual number of cpus
    detected from /proc/cpuinfo. If you specify more cpus than are
    installed in your system, only the worms that are mapped to an
    actual processor will grow longer and faster when cpu load increases
    for that processor. If you specify less cpus than are installed in
    your system, the program will default the display to the actual
    detected cpus.
-   –SPEEDUP
    speedup divisor to increase worm speed. functions as powers of 2
    i.e. speedup=4 runs at 4 times the speed, etc. Default value is 1.
-   –WORMSIZE
    size of the worm head in pixels in a range between 10 and 80.
    Default value is 30. Can be any value but works best if you use
    multiples of 2 to map to graphics screen dimensions (which are
    typically numbers which are multiples of 2 or 10).
-   –WINDOW
    Draw on a newly-created window. This is the default.
-   –ROOT
    Draw on the root window.
-   –MONO
    If on a color display, pretend we’re on a monochrome display.
-   –SHAPE
    Specify worm drawing mode:
    0 for squares, 1 for circles, 2 for snipes (from the NetWare game
    “Snipes”, the first distributed network game run over a local area
    network), 3 for triangles, 4 for classic (retro text-based
    screensaver from NetWare SMP), 5 for arrows 6 for 3D balls,
-   –INSTALL
    Install a private colormap for the window.
-   –VISUAL _VISUAL_
    Specify which visual to use. Legal values are the name of a visual
    class, or the id number (decimal or hex) of a specific visual.


ENVIRONMENT

-   DISPLAY
    to get the default host and display number.
-   XENVIRONMENT
    to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global
    resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.


BUILDING THE SCREENSAVER FROM SOURCE

It should be noted that since the xscreensaver-netwaresmp code base is
provided as a Source RPM and DEB packages, it’s very simple and straight
forward to rebuild the RPM or DEB packages without needing to resort to
a manual rebuild. However, users on ARM64 systems and Debian users may
need to build the program manually. You are encouraged to use the RPM
method to rebuild the code but in the event you need to do so manually,
the following section describes the steps for accomplishing this.

In order to build the xscreensaver with netwaresmp fully integrated, you
should first clone the xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp repository. This
repository is a generic xscreensaver-6.08 code base with the X11
netwaresmp screensaver included as a patch series. This approach is
implemented with a patch series in this manner for two reasons. First,
it is necessary to re-run the autoreconf automake program after
downloading the sources and applying the patch series in order to
integrate the netwaresmp screensaver into the xscreensaver-settings
configuration tool. The build for xscreensaver-settings setup utility
uses a static file to list integrated screensavers and this file is only
updated by running autoreconf against the code base. Second, this
approach allows the netwaresmp patch series to be applied to previous
versions of xscreensaver package prior to the 6.08 release.

Most Linux distributions use an outdated xscreensaver program which
lacks current bug fixes and new capabilities. It should be noted that
there are subtle programming differences between many of these earlier
versions. I have not fully tested the Netware SMP screensaver on all of
these earlier distributions, however, in most cases the existing
netwaresmp patch series should work on most of them. If you have
problems trying to apply the patch series to an xscreensaver release,
please feel free to post an Issue to Issues and I will look into it and
get back to you and provide an updated patch for that xscreensaver
distribution. It’s actually a lot better if you just choose to upgrade
to the xscreensaver 6.08 release since there have been many bug fixes
and enhanced features in the newer code base. It’s also a lot less
complicated since the newer release is a single RPM for the entire
xscreensaver distribution, instead of xscreensaver being provided as
dozens of packages for each xscreensaver distro such as RedHat provides,
which is difficult for end users to a manage and navigate.

Installing the xscreensaver-6.08 Code Base

You can clone the screensaver-6.08-netwaresmp code base from github as
follows using the ‘git clone’ command, or you can download the
xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-4.tar.gz archive directly from github,
then untar and extract the files.

Cloning from Github

    git clone https://github.com/jeffmerkey/xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp

After running the ‘git clone’ command, you should see something similiar
to:

    Cloning into 'xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 2199, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (2199/2199), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1366/1366), done.
    remote: Total 2199 (delta 796), reused 2192 (delta 789), pack-reused 0

    Resolving deltas: 100% (796/796), done.

Downloading

You can also download the xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-4.tar.gz
archive directly from github from the releases section for the
xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp code base:

-   xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-5.tar.gz

After you download the code base, untar the package into a directory:

    tar -xf xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-5.tar.gz 

The tar program should extract the files into the following directory.
Use ls -ld to list the directory and archive to verify it was untarred
correctly:

    [root@localhost Downloads]# ls -ld xscreensaver-\*
    drwxrwxr-x. 9 root    root        4096 Feb 18 22:25 xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-5
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 jmerkey jmerkey 20024886 Feb 20 20:56 xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-5.tar.gz

Applying the patch and running autoreconf

After you have either git cloned the code base or downloaded and
installed the code base manually, you must apply the patch series then
run autoreconf. Change directory into the code base directory and apply
the patch.

If you cloned the repository:

    [root@localhost]# cd xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp
    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# 

If you have downloaded and untarred the repository with the tar -xf
command manually:

    [root@localhost]# cd xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-5
    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp-6.08-5]# 

The patch is named netwaresmp-xscreensaver-6.08.patch. You should see a
file listing similiar to the following in the base source code
directory:

    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# ll
    total 1396
    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 137286 Feb 20 20:33 aclocal.m4

    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   3426 Feb 20 20:33 xscreensaver.spec
    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# 

Apply the patch with the following command:

    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# patch -p1 < netwaresmp-xscreensaver-6.08.patch 

The patching process should produde the following output:

    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# patch -p1 < netwaresmp-xscreensaver-6.08.patch
    patching file driver/XScreenSaver.ad.in
    patching file hacks/config/netwaresmp.xml
    patching file hacks/Makefile.in
    patching file hacks/netwaresmp.c
    patching file hacks/netwaresmp.man
    patching file xscreensaver.spec
    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]#

If you see a printout indicating the patch was successfully applied,
then you can now run autoreconf program and start the build. You can
apply this patch in a similiar manner to most of the xscreensaver code
bases prior to 6.08 and it will work on most of the distros. If you run
into trouble, post an Issues report on github at Issues / Problems /
Help .

Now run autoreconf to re-create the Makefiles and Configuration scripts:

    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# autoreconf -f -v 

You should see the followning output if autoreconf completed
successfully:

    autoreconf: Entering directory `.'
    autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Gettext
    autoreconf: running: aclocal --force 
    autoreconf: configure.ac: tracing
    autoreconf: configure.ac: AM_GNU_GETTEXT is used, but not AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION
    autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Libtool
    autoreconf: running: /usr/bin/autoconf --force
    autoreconf: running: /usr/bin/autoheader --force
    autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Automake
    autoreconf: Leaving directory `.'
    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# 

Now type ‘configure’ and then type ‘make’ to build the
xscreensaver-netwaresmp-6.08 package. If the make process succeeds, then
perform ‘make install’ to install the xscreensaver package to your
system:

    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# ./configure; 

Check to make certain the ./configure script completes with no errors.
If there were no errors the ./configure program returns a final listing
of created Makefiles and updated includes at the very end of the
configure script similiar to the following:

    current directory: /work/xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp
    command line was: ./configure
    ...

       #################################################################

        XScreenSaver will be installed in these directories:

                 User programs: /usr/local/bin/ (DIFFERS)
                 Screen savers: /usr/local/libexec/xscreensaver/ (DIFFERS)
                 Configuration: /usr/local/share/xscreensaver/config/ (DIFFERS)
                 Extra Fonts:   /usr/local/share/fonts/xscreensaver/ (DIFFERS)
                 App Defaults:  /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/

Now type make from the base directory to make and compile the
xscreensaver-netwaresmp package.

    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# make

If make succeeds without any errors, you can install the newly built
packages on your system with ‘make install’.

    [root@localhost xscreensaver-6.08-netwaresmp]# make install


BUILDING AS AN RPM PACKAGE

In order to build the screensaver as an RPM, the program must be
compressed into a tar.gz file and the tar.gz file named to match the
versioning information contained in the associated .spec file.

Spec files are special files which contain instructions on how to build
a particular package from a source code archive. On Red Hat and CentOS
systems, RPMS are built in the /root/rpmbuild/ top directory. SuSe
systems build RPMS in the /usr/src/packages/ as top directory. These
“top directories” will contain BUILD, BUILDROOT, SPECS, RPMS, SRPMS, and
SOURCES subdirectories.

The SPECS directory contains the *.spec files used to build RPMS and
SRPMS packages. The SOURCES subdirectory will contain the soure code
archive file referred to in the *.spec file used to build the RPM
package.

See the Quick Start Guide on instructions for installing the source rpm
which installs both the .spec file and source archive file (tar.gz) into
the rpm build top directory (i.e. /root/rpmbuild/). You should have
previously installed the src.rpm file before attempting to build the
rpm. You can also manually install the .spec file into the <top
directory>/SPECS/ directory and the source code tarball in the <top
directory/SOURCES/ directory, then attempt to build the rpm package.

To build the XScreensaver using the rpm tool, change directories (cd)
into the /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/ directory (/usr/src/packages/SPECS/ for
SuSe) and enter the following command:

    rpmbuild -ba xscreensaver-6.8.spec <enter>


BUILDING AS A DEBIAN PACKAGE

In order to build the screensaver as a Debian package, the program must
be compressed into a tar.gz file and the tar.gz file named to match the
versioning information contained in the associated .spec file. Spec
files are special files which contain instructions on how to build a
particular package from a source code archive.

Debian Packages can be built using a utility called “debbuild” and use a
top directory structure which is similar to that used by the RPM tool
but using /root/debbuild/ as the “top directory”. These “top
directories” will contain BUILD, BUILDROOT, SPECS, DEBS, SDEBS, and
SOURCES subdirectories and follows a similar layout that is used for RPM
files.

The SPECS directory contains the *.spec files used to build DEB and SDEB
packages. The SOURCES subdirectory will contain the soure code archive
file referred to in the *.spec file used to build the DEB and SDEB
packages.

See the Quick Start Guide on instructions for installing the source SDEB
which installs both the .spec file and source archive file (tar.gz) into
the debbuild top directory (i.e. /root/debbuild/). You should have
previously installed the SDEB file before attempting to build the DEB
package. You can also manually install the .spec file into the <top
directory>/SPECS/ directory and the source code tarball in the <top
directory/SOURCES/ directory, then attempt to build the DEB package.

To build the XScreensaver using debbuild, change directories (cd) into
the /root/debbuild/SPECS/ directory and enter the following command:

    debbuild -vv -ba xscreensaver-6.08.spec <enter>
